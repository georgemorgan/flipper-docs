# Flipper Documentation

The Flipper Docs are a collection of resources for teaching developers how to
build projects using Flipper and its tools.

The docs are hosted on [Flipper's website](flipper.io/docs/). They're included
as a git submodule of the
[website repository](github.com/georgemorgan/flipper-website) and built using
the site's jekyll setup. Thus, all of the docs pages must include a
[YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) with a `title`
attribute in order to be processed by jekyll and served with the site.
