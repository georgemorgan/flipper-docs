## Modules

By definition, a module lives on the device's hardware. Modules expose functions
that control the peripherals attached to the device in a predefined way.

#### Use case example.

Say you wanted write a driver for a new I2C sensor. In the early stages of
debugging, you would use the [I2C module](./modules-i2c.html) to interact with
the sensor, say from a Python application, on your PC. Once the basic
functionality of the driver has been implemented, it becomes practical to
consolidate the prototyped functionality onto your device. This is where modules
come in to play. You have a function called `my_sensor.read()` that encapsulates
dozens calls to the I2C module. Although the
[message runtime](./libflipper-fmr.html) is a powerful tool that can be used for
prototyping and debugging, it is not as fast as code running natively on the
device. By making your sensor driver into a module, you could reduce the number
of message runtime calls needed to interact with your sensor from dozens to
just the one needed to invoke your module's `read` function.

This documentation entry goes into detail about the structure of modules and how
to write them.

### Module structure.

All `libflipper` modules have the same structure consisting of three major
components.

- The virtual interface. (the module's jump table)
- The overlay. (the module's `enum`)
- The lf_module.

---

#### Virtual Interface

The primary component of a module is the module's *virtual interface*, which is
a jump table that enumerates all of the function addresses exposed by that
module. The virtual interface of a simple module called `my_module` that exposes
a single function `test` is declared as follows.

```c
extern const struct _my_module {
    my_module_configure,
    my_module_test
} my_module;
```

You may have noticed that the module also must expose a configuration function.
This function is executed when the module is first loaded. The module author may
choose to leave this function empty, but due to expectations of the loader its
address must be present as the first entry in the module's jump table.

#### Overlay

Once the virtual interface has been declared, the message runtime must have a
way to know the layout of the functions that exist within the module. This is
accomplished using an `enum` to enumerate the indices of the functions present
in a module.

For the module declared above, the accompanying overlay is as follows.

```c
enum { _my_module_configure, _my_module_test };
```

You can see that the items in the `enum` have the same names as the functions in
the module, but prefixed with an `_`. The order of the items in the `enum` must
match the order of the functions as they are declared in the jump table.

### lf_module

The final step taken to prepare a module for accessibility by the message
runtime is to declare its `lf_module` object. The `lf_module` object can be
declared manually using the following preprocessor macro.

```c
LF_MODULE(_my_module, "my_module", "Performs operations using x, y, and z.", -1);
```

This syntax creates an `lf_module` structure called `_my_module` and populates
it with the module's plaintext name and description, as well as the module's
index. At the time of the module's declaration, however, this index is not
known, and is thus set to `-1`. If the index is not set to `-1`, undefined
behavior could result if an invocation were to be performed on the module.

> **Note:** It is much safer to create modules using the
> [package manager](./package-manager.html). The package manager handles the
> creation of the `lf_module` structure automatically, and provides a template
> for the module's virtual interface and overlay. The package manager also
> provides warnings about modules that may be incorrectly defined.

Once the lf_module structure has been defined, it needs to be bound to a module
that has been loaded onto the device.
