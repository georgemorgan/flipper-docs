title: Flipper Message Runtime

## FMR

The Flipper Message Runtime, or **FMR** for short, is the component of
`libflipper` that makes all of the magic happen. The message runtime is
responsible for transferring information about how to invoke functions, transfer
data, load modules, launch applications, and more to the device attached to the
current instance of [libflipper](./).

### Theory

The message runtime uses a variety of mechanisms, both software and hardware
based, to convey information about remote procedure calls, data transfers, and
more from the 'host' to the 'device' registered in the hierarchy.

The message runtime focuses primarily on remote procedure invocation. However,
using **subclasses**, the message runtime can also implement platform specific
functionality. Specific functionality can be achieved by defining an enumeration
of subclass values and registering them within the switch case located inside
`fmr_perform`.

### Performing an invocation.

The most basic functionality enabled by the message runtime is the ability to
invoke functions remotely. As such, the message runtime serves as the backbone
for the remote procedure calling functionality of the toolbox.

To invoke a function, an [lf_module](./modules#lf_module) reference must have
been obtained using the `lf_bind` function.

The routine used to perform the invocation is as below.

```c
lf_invoke(_my_module, _my_function, NULL);
```

This syntax instructs the message runtime to call the function `_my_function`
located within the module `_my_module` that has already been loaded on the
device to which the module belongs. The `NULL` passed to the parameters field
of the `lf_invoke` function tells the message runtime that no arguments are to
be passed to the target function.
