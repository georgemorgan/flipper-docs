# What is Flipper?

Flipper is an embedded development platform that aims to make it simple to
build powerful hardware electronics projects quickly.
Flipper introduces a new perspective to hardware projects by shifting the
focus of the developer away from the limitations of embedded systems and onto
the goals of the project itself. It does this by providing a software library
that allows programs on a host machine to execute functions on Flipper
remotely. A host machine can be a desktop computer, a smartphone, or even a
server in the cloud. This means that you can write Flipper applications for
any platform - and using any programming language.

Flipper's unique capablities give us a lot of opportunities to make life
easier for embedded developers.
