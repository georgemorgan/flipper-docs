## configure

The `configure` function initializes the button hardware. This function is
called automatically on startup, and should not need to be called from
user applications.

```

> **returns**: `int` representing the success of the operation.
> - `lf_success` when configuration succeeded.
> - `lf_error` when configuration failed.

```
$ flipper button configure
```

## read

The `read` function returns the button state as described above.

```c
button.read()
```

> **returns**: `uint8_t` representing the button state.
> - `0` when the button is released.
> - `1` when the button is pressed.

**console syntax**

```
$ flipper button read
```
