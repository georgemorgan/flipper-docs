ABI
===

The Flipper Application Binary Interface, or ABI, organizes metadata in a known layout at the beginning of a module or application image about the location of the package's code, data, and dependancies.

### Memory Map

The binary image of a Flipper package has the following structure.

```
/*------------------------------+  0x0000     --+
 |            &(main)           |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x0004       |
 |        sizeof(.module)       |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x0008       |
 |           &(.module)         |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x000c       |
 |          sizeof(.data)       |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x0010       | - HEADER
 |            &(.data)          |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x0014       |
 |          sizeof(.bss)        |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x0018       |
 |            &(.bss)           |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x001c       |
 |          sizeof(.got)        |               |
 +------------------------------+  0x0020     --+
 |            &(.got)           |
 +------------------------------+  [0x0008]
 |           .module            |
 +------------------------------+
 |            .text             |
 +------------------------------+  [0x0010]
 |            .data             |
 +------------------------------+  [0x0018]
 |             .bss             |

 ```

### Header

The ABI header is found at the top of every device binary. This header tells the loader how to correctly copy segments of the image into memory as well as how to patch those segments to ensure the image runs properly.

As shown in the memory map above, the header contains the addresses of the major sections of the image relative to the image's base address (offset addresses), as well as the size of each section. The header also contains the offset address of the image's entry point (if the image is an application) in addition to the offset address and size of the image's [virtual interface](libflipper-modules.html#Virtual\ Interface).

### Position Independant Code

Compiling an application as position independant to form position independant code, or **PIC**, generates machine instructions that exclusively make use of relative indirection. PIC is important when creating images that are to be deployed on Flipper hardware because the compiler has no guarentees about where in the device's memory the image will be loaded.

### Global Offset Table

The presence of a Global Offset Table, or **GOT**, is a side effect of generating code that is position independant. Due to the uncertainty about where in memory an image will be loaded, the locations of the variables that live in the `.data` and `.bss` sections are unknown at compile time. It is the job of the loader to patch the addresses of these variables at runtime. This process is carried out by adding the base address at which the image was loaded into memory to all the cells of the GOT, a *table* in memory reserved specifically to hold the *offsets* (from the base address of the image) at which *global* variables live.
